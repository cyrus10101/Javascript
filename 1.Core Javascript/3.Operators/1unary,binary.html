    // "unary", "binary", "operand"

    // operand
    // An operand is what operators are applied to. like for example a + b in this case " a " and " b " is operands and " + " is operator.
    
    // Unary 
    // An opertor is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of number.
        let x = 1;
        
        x = -x; // Here -1, unary negation was applied
        document.getElementById("text1").innerHTML = x;
    

    // Binary
    // An operator is binary if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well. 
        let xx = 1, yy = 3
        document.getElementById("text2").innerHTML = yy - xx;
